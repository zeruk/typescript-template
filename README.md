# typescript-template
Ideal (in my opinion) typescript template

It has preinstalled:
- TS/JS linting + prettifying - with usage of [_XO_](https://github.com/xojs/xo) and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- TS config
- Testing with usage of jest, ts-jest
- commitlint with [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) setting
- commit checks on git hooks with usage of [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- CI for lint + commitlint
- CI for tests
- CI for automatic releases and package publish (`docs`, `style`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci` commit prefixes are [hidden](https://git.io/JqCZL))
